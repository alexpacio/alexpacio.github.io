<p>For various reasons, I have often been involved in resolving infrastructural issues and performance gaps in MySQL deployments. I never envisioned my career focusing on database systems, yet it seems there is still a high demand for OLTP technologies in the Italian market, so here I am.</p>
<p>When you deal with a large dataset (over 500GB) with huge tables (more than 100 million rows), it's not hard to face performance issues. While many solutions exist for running analytical queries (OLAP) on large datasets by leveraging distributed systems, they are not typically "real-time" systems and often operate on stale data. When you have numerous, complex analytical queries — or expensive operations like <em>COUNT(DISTINCT)</em> — hat must be submitted against a fresh, real-time system, you have no choice: you need to run them on your OLTP engine.</p>

<p>The other day, I was contacted by a friend of mine asking for help setting up a home NAS (aka Network Attached Storage) based on OpenMediaVault. While he's an enthusiast, he wasn't able to properly configure all the technical aspects of the setup.</p>
<p>The NAS world is increasingly resembling a homelab rather than just file storage. Using Docker, you can get enterprise-grade software and setups running with quite simple steps.</p>
<p>After setting up the Docker containers, we faced the usual issue that most homelabs encounter these days: his internet connection was behind a CGNAT for IPv4 networking. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find an IPv6 public subnet already configured!</p>

    <section id="statically-linked-programs-are-the-evil"><h2>Statically-linked Programs are the evil</h2>
<p>The trend toward static linking represents a fundamental regression in software engineering principles. By bundling every dependency directly into the executable, we're not just bloating our binaries - we're actively dismantling decades of progress in software modularization. Each statically linked program becomes an island, disconnected from the ecosystem of shared improvements and security updates.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when a critical vulnerability is discovered in a commonly used library. In a properly designed system using shared libraries, a single system update would protect all applications simultaneously. Instead, with static linking, we must embark on a complex and error-prone process of identifying every affected program, rebuilding each one individually, and ensuring they all get redeployed.</p>

<section id="introduction"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Some may certainly say that, when you are writing so called "daemons" under Linux/Unix OSes or "services" under Windows, you might want to use OS primitives/reuse existing libraries to make your programs communicate each other. And I strongly agree with the point: it is always a good idea to use a well-tested and solid library to implement such fundamental features such as message queues.</p>
<p>For example, under Linux you can use D-Bus, which allows IPC at scale within the OS scope. Or, in the microservices space, you can leverage on message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka to stream your messages through sophisticated routing logic. However, at times you are just looking for something trivial and simple to send and queue messages where at the same time you look for brokerless setup but still you are willing to leverage on some of the features that message queuing systems offer for free with ease. That's where ZeroMQ comes in.</p>

<p>As developers, we often come across situations where a fully-fledged background job system, with all its bells and whistles, might be overkill for our project needs. This was the case for me when I built a custom background job scheduler in <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, designed to handle essential tasks without the overhead of larger, more complex solutions.</p>

<p>Last week, I was contacted for a coding challenge. The project seemed interesting, so I decided to take it on. At the very least, I would learn something new, which I was eager to explore: Pulumi, k6, FastAPI and some fancy modern things that make you look like a cool dev!</p>
<p>The project involved creating a simple REST API in Python, which needed to be packaged with Helm, ready for deployment in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, and including all the essential tools required.</p>
